The CSS code has an unexpected behavior when using the `calc()` function with percentages and lengths. For example, the following code attempts to set the width of an element to 50% of its parent's width minus 10px:

```css
#myElement {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

However, this might not work as expected in some browsers because of the order of operations.  Some browsers might calculate 50% first, then subtract 10px from the resulting value, while others might try to subtract 10px from 50% directly which is invalid calculation.

This can lead to unexpected layout issues.
